    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Tamal Tolimense is a beloved traditional dish from Colombia’s Tolima region, known for its rich flavor and comforting ingredients. Wrapped in plantain leaves and steamed, this tamal is made with a seasoned corn dough (masa) filled with a savory mix of pork, chicken, rice, peas, carrots, potatoes, and hard-boiled eggs. The slow cooking process infuses the ingredients with deep, hearty flavor, making it a popular choice for breakfast or special occasions, often enjoyed with a hot cup of chocolate or coffee.</p>
