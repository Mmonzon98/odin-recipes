    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ajiaco is a beloved traditional soup from Bogotá, Colombia, cherished for its comforting warmth and rich, layered flavors. This iconic dish is made with three varieties of potatoes—criolla (small and yellow), sabanera (red-skinned), and pastusa (white)—which each contribute different textures and thickness to the broth. The soup is simmered with bone-in chicken, fresh corn on the cob, and a native Colombian herb called guasca, which gives ajiaco its signature earthy taste. Typically served in deep bowls, ajiaco is accompanied by white rice, sliced avocado, capers, and a dollop of crema de leche (Colombian-style cream), allowing each person to customize their bowl. It’s more than just a meal; ajiaco is a symbol of Colombian heritage and hospitality, often enjoyed during family gatherings or holidays.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 chicken breasts (bone-in, skinless)</li>
        <li>3 ears of fresh corn, cut into halves</li>
        <li>3 medium russet (pastusa) potatoes, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>3 red (sabanera) potatoes, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>6 small yellow (criolla) potatoes, whole and unpeeled</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 bunch of fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried guasca (Colombian herb)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Capers, avocado slices, and crema de leche (for serving)</li>
        <li>Cooked white rice (optional, served on the side)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken breasts in a large pot with about 10 cups of water. Add the chopped onion, garlic, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30–40 minutes until the chicken is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the pot, shred it into bite-sized pieces, and set it aside. Leave the broth in the pot.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced russet and red potatoes to the broth and cook for about 15 minutes until they begin to soften.</li>
        <li>Add the whole yellow (criolla) potatoes and the corn halves to the pot. Continue to cook until all potatoes are tender and start to thicken the soup—about 20 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the guasca and let the soup simmer for another 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend.</li>
        <li>Return the shredded chicken to the pot and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.</li>
        <li>To serve, ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with capers, a spoonful of crema de leche, and avocado slices. Serve with a side of white rice if desired.</li>
    </ol>
